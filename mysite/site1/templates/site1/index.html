The study of physics at the nanoscale and in biology has been a topic of ongoing research in recent years due to the staggering array of structural variety that may be extrapolated to materials research and in the study of polymeric chemistry and pharmaceutical development. The inherent complexity of these nanoscale systems, stemming from the web of interactions involved in the manufacture and maintenance of structures such as micelles, vesicles, proteins and polymeric bilayers allow the wide range of phenomena seen in these <em>soft</em> structures. However, this very complexity also raises question into how to effectively analyse the root causes of the effects in question. For this reason, <em>molecular simulation</em> has been applied to model the nanoscale system of interest, as an additional angle of observation from traditional experimental methods, with unique advantages originating from the application of theoretical methods and machinery that would be physically impossible with traditional methods.

The majority of the molecular interactions we encounter in such biophysical systems we encounter are intermolecular/intramolecular forces - 
the former coming into prominence in the aggregation of monomers, and the latter coming into effect when we encounter the change in the internal conformation of the molecule. These systems in question do not reach the energetic levels of which the formation and breaking of covalent/ionic bonds become relevant - due to this nature, this field of research has been known to have <em>soft</em> interactions, and the field has been noted as <em>soft matter</em>. In practical terms, SM is distract from ordered, hard materials (such as ionic solids) in that the interactions are mediated by moderate strength (of order of kT, where k is the <em>Boltzmann</em> constant and T refers to the <em>temperature</em>, usually 298 K to depict room temperature), often bounded by ~ above/below the room temperature. The combination of these forces results in the complex architecture in biology we seek to explore - specifically, we encounter significant cotributions from short-range and long-range forces such as the <em> Van der Waals</em> (VdW) and <em>Coulombic</em> forces respectively. Forces arising from dipoles, ion-dipole interactions, steric interactions also contribute significantly to the resulting structure. In particular, the hydrophobic and hydrophilic effect (<em>water-hating</em> and <em>water-loving</em> respectively) requires a particular mention, due to it's prominence and it's effect to control the degree of aggregation of molecules.

For example, a purely hydrophobic compound, such as long-chained hydrocarbon species, when in a mixture with water, can completely <em>phase-separate</em> to form layers immiscible liquids, due to the attraction between hydrophobic species, and it's repulsion to hydrophilic species. The key molecular component of consideration are those with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components (termed as <em>amphiphilic</em> species) - the hydrophilic component provides a favourable interaction site against the surrounding charged/aqueous environment, while the hydrophobic component aggregate <em>away</em> from the aqueous layer - with the addition of the hydrophilic headgroup, the overall hydrophobicity of each molecule is reduced, which reduces the unfavourable energetic cost of the species in contact with a aqueous environment. In addition, the geometric preference of the hydrophilic species to point towards the bulk charged/hydrophilic solvent acts as the limiting factor to complete phase separation. This is the key attribute that distinguishes amphiphilic species.
<!--  Talk about non-bio lipids-->
Figure <> shows examples of the variety of structures that can be formed with amphiphilic monomers. For example, CH2-CH2-X derivative lipid derivative lipid species (such as ...) can come with a variety of charged headgroups

The same principle applies in a biophysical context; the aggregate amphiphilic bilayers form the basic building block of cellular membranes, and the various organelles within the cytoplasm.
<!-- -->
<!-- Talk about the biolipids-->
For example, CH2-CH2-X derivative lipid species comes in a variety of charged headgroup , saturated/unsaturated tailgroups and can contain species as components which affect the overall fluidity and bulk hydrophibicity. What <em>distinguishes</em> he bilayer we observe in cellular environments compared to manufactured polymeric vesicles and their equivalents is the enormous variety/heterogenuity of the species involved. A recent study counted an estimate of # DPPC and similar derivaties. What is interesting is the different \% composition we observe within cellular components - ### et al observed that there is a predominant feature of <em>sphinolipids</em> present in neural tissue. A 3-4 component structure of DPPC and it's variations is highly common, with a universal <em>cholestrol</em> content, with variations depending on the organelle. The cataloguing of the individual components and their specific effects in an organelle is a critical part of research of drug delivery mechanism pathways, nanotoxicity and related pharmaceutical research. In short, the idea of modifying a large polymeric aggregation such as polymersomes has been explored in recent years, as a novel revenue of materials research. The large variation in composition is also matched by the avaliable geometric variation in large vesicular structures, many of which are utilised as part of natural processes. For example, pollen grains in nature are constructed from spiky particles which increases it's surface area, allowing a higher chance of attaching onto a surface, through ... interactions ... <!-- Need to explain why the pollen molecules are important -->

<h1>Molecular Simulations applied to Soft Matter Systems </h1>
<p>As articulated before, the use of <em>molecular simulation</em> techniques has become increasingly prevalent both as a auxillary analysis method combined with traditional experimental methods, as well as a standalone methodology. In the past, the high convergence timescale of large, complex biophysical systems hindered it's use as a practical method to study scientific phenomena. Decades of technological advances, following the pattern of Moore's law, we have seen great improvements in computational power; by combining this with with techniques such as parallization of computer nodes to speed up the calculation of interactions/movements of systems, it has become possible to reach timescales where we can gain practical information that provide new insights. We alluded to the fact that the molecular interactions of SM do not involve energy scales for bond-forming/bond-breaking reactions, which would require complicated and computational demanding quantum mechanical calculations. Hence, by imitating classical dynamics, it is possible to accurately record the physical evolution of a system. Two practical methodologies are used for this purpose - the <em> Monte-Carlo </em> and <em> Molecular Dynamics </em> simulation methods. The former relies on the moving each molecular component based upon the most <em>likely</em> move based upon the boltzmann factor, while the latter method relies upon an iterative time-evoluton of Newton's equations of motion. The advantage and disadvantages of each method often depends on the specific system one analyses, and the development of either process is an ongoing field of research.       
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
Clearly, the key problem of every complex simulation is this - <em>How do we capture the accurate physics of a specific process of interest, within a reasonable timescale?</em> Even with the computational resources avaliable at present, it can be difficult to reach a timescale for a reaction of interest to be observed, and then one must account for the limitation of only having a <em>screenshot</em> of a system. Complex processes such as protein conformational changes and protein-ligand interactions can only be observed through forcing the system to bias towards an environment where these changes can occur in the allocated time. Collectively, the change of state in these processes follow a pathway which are conveniently referred to as <em>reaction coordinates</em>, and shall be referred to as such. Many independent research groups have approached (add citations here) to develop collection of methods known as <em>biased-sampling methods</em>, which collectively have attempted to try to sample these <em>high-energy</em> states that constitute the reaction coordinate of interest.
<!-- metadynamics -->
A number of options are avaliable for measuring the free energy change of a complex reaction coordinate. For example, metadynamics follows the approach of adding unfavourable gaussian potentials to previously mapped phase space, to ensure that the process maps new parts of the reaction coordinate, from which the free energy landscape can be recovered from the sum of the gaussian distributions. 
<!-- Umbrella Sampling -->
The most common method for calculating the free energy change, due to it's relative simplicity of implementation, and intuitive familiarity, 
is the <em>umbrella sampling</em> method. This involves dividing the reaction coordinate into discrete bins, and a biasing potential (usually in the form of hooks potential) is implemented to sample the rare-event trajectory incrementally. These new sampling bins are recombined and unbiased to produce the final free energy profile. Whilst this method has proven highly effective at producing the free energy profiles of many complex processes, such as ligand-docking simulations, protein conformational change and    

<!-- Steered Molecular Dynamics -->
The primary non-equilibrium method mimicking atomic force microscopy (AFM)/force probe experiments has also been explored for free energy change - the <em>steered molecular dynamics</em> (SMD) method - by tethering a theoretical moving spring onto the molecule of question, this follows a continuous movement along the RC, which allows the calculation of the force, and hence, the <em>work</em> input. An interesting equality that relates work (a path integral function that is <em>directionally dependent</em>) with the free energy is the Jarzynski equality, which states that the mean of the exponential of work can be related to the exponential of the free energy. Due to the non-equilibrium nature of this equality, this suggests that the free energy can be calculated from the average of multiple fast-running simulations i.e. this is a <em>parallel</em> method of calculating the free energy, compared to the <em>serial</em> method of the umbrella sampling method.

  });
  });
</script>
</p>
In addition to enhanced sampling methods, an additional way to reach longer timescales has involved simplifying the molecular model itself. As of today, an extensive range of surfactants, lipids, and protein components have been parameterized in terms of <em>molecular mechanics</em> (MM), where the bond potential, angular potential, intermolecular and intramolecular potentials are given a highly detailed expression. Collectively, these are known as <em>force fields</em> (FF). The full atomic molecular description to include the full MM potentials in a FF comes with dramatic drawbacks - it limits the size of the simulation, which may produce an unphysical system, where the cut-off distances of each atomic component may be too large for the system, and as mentioned, the longer timescales required for convergence of properties may not be reached. To compensate for this, methods for simplification of the molecular model has been sought. For example, DPPC lipids and their derivatives (headgroup or tailgroup variation) have been characterized by Marrink <em>et al</em> using <em>coarse-graining</em> methods. CG methods involve simplifying the superfluous elements in an <em>all-atomic</em> (AA) simulation - for example, the interaction parameters in each CH_{x} component in the chain is composed of 4 bonding potentials (with the C-C bonds included), 2 spring potentials, an dihedral potential and torsional potentials - here, these individual components are not of great interest in the reaction coordinate of interest, yet require significant computational resources to analyse and recalculate with each timestep. By the CG procedure, multiple chains components can be approximate to a single bead, therefore speeding up the calculation of the equations of motion and convergence of physical properties. For example, Marrink <em> et al</em> estimated that the limit on biophysical MD simulations within reasonable timescales is 5000 AA lipids, or 50,000 CG lipids in CG models. A large range of AA and CG catalogues are avaliable, such as CHARMM/AMBER models for AA simulations, and MARTINI/SDK models to name a few.

<h2>Types of NPs and their environmental effects</h2> 
Given the delicate environment of the cellular membrane, the question of how external nanoscale objects affect it's composition and geometry has been a question of great significance. Here, we follow the convention of simplifying these objects as <em>nanoparticles</em> (NPs). A large variety of NPs have been demonstrated to affect the membrane infrastructure. For example, carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) of nanometre (nm) scale diameter and radii can originate from diesel based soot in urban environments, and fine particulate matter in natural soot as well. A CNP of particular note is the fullerene structure, which consists of a hollow spherical allotrope. It's unique electronic and chemical properties has resulted in it's widescale use in industry, including it's potential as a source of nanotoxicity or a novel drug delivery mechanism - For example, clinical studies studying the effects of CNPs showed aggregation inside the lipid bilayer. 
<!--Induction of Inflammasome Dependent Pyroptosis by Carbon Black Nanoparticles -->
<!--Nanoparticles, free radicals and oxidative stress -->
<!-- -->
Modifications to the CNP structure and geometry also has been demonstrated to affect it's cellular internalization mechanism. For example, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are cyclindrical equivalents to the fullerene type NPs - the geometric anisotropy plays a critical role in it's material  characteristics - 
<!-- -->
CNTs of comparable size to a spherical CNP has been shown to undergo a bilayer translocation through a different mechanism, namely that of 
<!-- -->
and larger ones go through a wrapping mechanism known as <em>endocytosis</em>, where the membrane curves to engulf the CNT, which required an input of energy.
<!-- Carbon nanotubes affect the toxicity of CuO nanoparticles to denitrification of CuO nanoparticles
     to denitrification in marine sediments by altering cellular internalization of nanoparticle , Nature, Scientific reports, 2016-->
Another effect that is under investigation is the enhanced production of <em>free radicals</em> (molecular species that are highly reactive due to a unpaired electron) in the presence of CNPs - cellular components have natural defence mechanisms for combating excessive reactive oxidative species (ROS) (oxygen based free radical components) such as superoxide dimutase in the mitochondria. As CNPs have been demonstrated to aggregrate within the cellular environment, this provides a large surface area to mass ratio for the ROS to develop, which can result in an excess of ROS overcoming the natural defences of the cell.

Environmental studies have also assessed that the <em>cross-interaction</em> between copper oxide (CuO) NPs and CNTs can hinder the toxic effects of the CuO NPs on microbial denitrification - an essential environmental process for fixing nitrogen into the environent. The evidence suggested that while CNT on its own does not affect the denitrification, the CuO-CNT interaction limits the NADH hindrance by the CuO NP, through the hindrance of the CuO uptake by the bacterial cellular membranes.         
<!--Quantifying thiol-gold interactions towards the efficient strength control -->
<h2> Surface Functionalization </h2>
Following the example set by the modification of rigid CNP/SiO NPs by functionalization, self-assembled monolayers (SAM) on a NP surface has been the basis of a promising field of materials research. Here, molecular simulation becomes a particularly powerful tool of analysis - the dependence of the integrity of a SAM-NP is highly sensitive on the pH, temperature, types of solvents and the lipid types involved in it's interaction. Molecular simulation provides an effective <em>in-vivo</em> comparison - the interaction between a NP surface ligand and every component inside the bilayer can be measured, which is still beyond modern microscopy and spectroscopic methods avaliable.  
<!-- How do the Size, Charge and Shape of Nanoparticles Affect Amyloid Beta Aggregation on Brain Lipid Bilayer? -->
Such modified NPs have been demonstrated as being powerful candidates for drug delivery. For example, AuNPs have been shown to aggregate in brain-tissue supported lipid bilayers (brain SLP) near regions where high densities of amyloid beta aggregates form, where the beta aggregates have been hypothesised as the primary cause of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers.
